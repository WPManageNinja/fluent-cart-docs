# Configuring Shipping Zones in FluentCart

Shipping zones are geographical areas where you offer specific shipping methods and rates. By defining zones, you can tailor your shipping options to different regions of the world.

## How to Add and Manage Shipping Zones

1.  **Navigate to Shipping Settings**:
    * From your WordPress dashboard, go to **FluentCart Pro** > **Settings**.
    * Click on the **Shipping** tab.
    * Select the **Shipping Zones** sub-tab.


2.  **Add a New Shipping Zone**:
    * Click the **"Add Shipping Zone"** button.
    * You will be taken to the "Add Shipping Zone" detail page.

3.  **Define Zone Details**:
    * **Zone Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your shipping zone (e.g., "Domestic - USA", "European Union", "Local Delivery Area"). This name will help you identify the zone in your settings.
    * **Regions**: Select the specific countries that belong to this zone. You can start typing to search for countries and select them from the dropdown.

4.  **Save the Shipping Zone**:
    * Once you have entered all the necessary details, click the **"Save Shipping Zone"** button.

Your new shipping zone will now appear in the list of zones, and you can proceed to add [shipping methods](/guide/shipping/setting-up-shipping-methods.md) to it.

**Important Considerations**:
* Customers will only see shipping methods applicable to the zone their shipping address falls into.
<!-- * FluentCart processes zones from top to bottom (most specific to least specific). If a customer's address matches multiple zones, the most specific one will apply. -->
