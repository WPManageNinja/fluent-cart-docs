 # General Settings (Store Setup)

The **General Settings (Store Setup)** screen is where you configure the fundamental information about your FluentCart store. This includes your store's name, logo, physical address, and essential currency settings, all of which are crucial for the basic operation and branding of your online business.

## Accessing General Settings

1.  Go to your WordPress dashboard, then go to **FluentCart Pro > Settings** in the left side menu.
2.  Normally, you'll see the **"Store Settings"** tab, which is where you find the General Settings.

## Configuring Your Store Details

### 1. General Information

* **Store Name:** Enter the official name of your online store. This name will often appear in various parts of your store, emails, and reports.
* **Store Logo:** You can upload your brand's logo here. This logo may be used in receipts, invoices, or other areas of your store.
    * Click the **"Remove"** button if you wish to remove an existing logo.

### 2. Order Mode

Select your storeâ€™s order mode from the dropdown. There are two options: **Test** and **Live**. Use "Test Mode" while setting up your store. Switch to "Live Mode" when you're ready to start accepting real orders.

### 2. Store Address

Provide your physical business address details. This information can be used for shipping calculations, tax purposes, and displayed in various store documents.

* **Address Line 1:** Enter the primary line of your street address.
* **Address Line 2 (Optional):** Enter any additional address details.
* **Country:** Select your store's operating country from the dropdown.
* **State:** Enter your state or province.

Configure the currency settings for your store's transactions.

* **Checkout Currency:** Select the primary currency in which your products will be priced and payments will be processed.
* **Number Format:** This setting lets you choose how numbers, especially prices, are shown in your store. It controls whether you use commas or dots to separate thousands and decimals.
* **Currency Position:** Select where the currency symbol should appear relative to the amount.

### 4. Payment View

The Payment View setting allows you choose how payment methods look to your customers on the checkout page. You can pick from a dropdown options:

* **Logo:** This option displays the actual brand picture (logo) for each payment method (e.g., the PayPal logo instead of just the word "PayPal").
* **Radio** This shows payment methods as simple choices you can click, like a small circle next to their name (e.g., "PayPal" as text).

## Saving Your Settings

After making any changes to your General Settings, remember to click the **"Save Settings"** button at the bottom right of the screen to apply your configurations.
