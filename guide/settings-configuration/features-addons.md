# Features & Addons

The **Features & Addons** section in FluentCart is where you can activate or deactivate major modules and high-level functionalities. This allows you to tailor the plugin's capabilities to your store's specific needs by enabling only the features you intend to use.

### Accessing Features & Addons

1. From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Settings**.
2. The **Store Setup** tab is selected by default, where you will find the **Features & Addons** section.

### Managing Available Features

This area contains toggles for the core modules available in FluentCart.

* **License Settings:** This toggle controls the entire software licensing system.
    * **Enabled:** When active (indicated by the "Active" status toggle), you can create and sell products that require license keys, such as software or plugins. All licensing-related settings will be available throughout the plugin.
    * **Disabled:** If toggled off, all features for selling licensed products will be deactivated and hidden.

#### Saving Your Changes

After enabling or disabling a feature, you must save your configuration. Click the **Save Settings** button at the top right of the screen to apply your changes.
