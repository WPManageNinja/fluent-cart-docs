### Step 2: Understand the Available Templates

On this page, you will find a series of editors for different types of fulfillment documents. While the customization process is the same for all, each serves a unique purpose:

* **Invoice Template:** The official bill for the customer, detailing the products purchased and the total cost.
* **Packing Slip Template:** A list of all items included in a shipment, typically placed inside the package for the customer to verify the contents.
* **Delivery Slip Template:** A document that accompanies the shipment, often used by the courier and customer as proof of delivery.
* **Shipping Slip Template:** Contains shipping information and is often used as a simplified address label.
* **Dispatch Slip Template:** An internal document used by your team to confirm that an order has been picked, packed, and sent out for delivery.

### Step 3: Customize a Template

The customization process is identical for each of the five templates. Select the template you wish to edit and use the provided tools.

* **Direct Editing:** You can directly type in the editor to add custom messages, format text (bold, italics, etc.), or adjust the layout.
* **Advanced Editing:** For precise control, you can switch between the **Visual** editor and the **Code** editor to work directly with the template's HTML.
* **Using Shortcodes:** To automatically include order-specific details like customer names, addresses, or order IDs, use shortcodes.
    1.  Place your cursor in the editor where you want the information to appear.
    2.  Click the **Add ShortCodes** dropdown menu.
    3.  Select the desired placeholder from the list to insert it into the template.
