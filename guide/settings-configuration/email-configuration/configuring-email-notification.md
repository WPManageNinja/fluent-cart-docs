# Configuring Email Notifications

The **Notifications** section in FluentCart is where you manage all the automated transactional emails that are sent to both your customers and store administrators. Keeping your customers informed about their order status is crucial for a professional e-commerce experience.

This guide will walk you through how to manage, edit, and customize these important email notifications.

#### Step 1: Navigate to the Notifications Screen

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Settings**.
2.  Click on the **Email Configuration** tab.
3.  From the sub-menu, select **Notifications**.

#### Step 2: Manage Your Notifications

On this screen, you will see a list of all available email notifications.

**Available Notifications**

Here is a list of the default email notifications that you can manage within FluentCart:

* **Send mail to admin after New Order Paid:** Notifies the store admin when a new order has been successfully paid for.
* **Purchase receipt to customer:** Sends a receipt to the customer immediately after their order is placed.
* **Send mail to customer after a subscription renewed:** Confirms to the customer that their subscription renewal payment was successful.
* **Send mail to admin after a subscription renewed:** Alerts the admin that a subscription renewal payment has been made.
* **Send mail to admin after a refund:** Informs the admin that a full or partial refund has been processed.
* **Send mail to customer after a refund:** Notifies the customer that a refund has been issued for their order.
* **Send mail to customer when shipping status changed to shipped:** Informs the customer that their physical order has been shipped.
* **Send mail to customer when shipping status changed to delivered:** Confirms to the customer that their order has been marked as delivered.


For each notification in the list, you can see its **Name**, the intended **Recipient** (Admin or Customer), and toggle options on the right:

* **Enable/Disable Toggle:** Use this switch to quickly activate or deactivate any notification. The email will only be sent if the toggle is enabled.
