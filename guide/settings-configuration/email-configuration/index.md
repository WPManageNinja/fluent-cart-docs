# Email Configuration

The **Email Configuration** section is the central hub for managing all aspects of the emails your FluentCart store sends to customers and administrators. Properly configuring these settings is essential for maintaining brand consistency, ensuring reliable email delivery, and keeping everyone informed about store activity.

This area is divided into two main sections, each handling a different aspect of your store's email communications.

#### Mailing Settings

This is where you set the global identity for all outgoing emails. Before customizing individual notifications, it's important to configure these settings to ensure your emails are professional and trustworthy.

In this section, you will learn how to:
* Set the "From Name" and "From Email" that your customers will see.
* Specify a "Reply-to" address to route customer inquiries.
* Create a universal email footer with your business details for compliance.
* Set the email address for receiving admin notifications.

#### Notifications

This section allows you to manage the content and status of every automated, event-triggered email your store sends. These are the transactional emails that confirm actions for both customers and admins.

In this section, you will learn how to:
* Enable or disable individual email notifications (e.g., "Order Created," "Payment Paid").
* Edit the subject line for any notification.
* Customize the email body with your own text and branding using a rich text editor and shortcodes.
