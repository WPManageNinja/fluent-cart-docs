### Choosing Your VAT Collection Method

The first time you visit this screen, FluentCart will launch a setup wizard to help you choose how you want to collect VAT in the EU. This choice is crucial as it determines how tax rates are applied to your customers.

Here’s a breakdown of the three options to help you choose the right one for your business:

**1. Collect using a One Stop Shop (OSS) registration**

This is the most common and recommended method for businesses that sell to customers in multiple EU countries. The OSS system simplifies your VAT obligations by allowing you to declare and pay the VAT for all your EU sales through a single registration in one EU member state.
* **Who it's for:** Businesses of any size that have a single OSS VAT number and want to streamline their tax reporting for the entire EU.

**2. Collect using your home country registration**

This option is specifically designed for small and micro-businesses based within the EU that have a low volume of cross-border sales.
* **Who it's for:** EU-based micro-businesses with total cross-border EU sales of less than €10,000 per year. This allows you to apply your home country's VAT rate to all sales within the EU, simplifying your tax process significantly.

**3. Collect specific country rate**

This is an advanced method for businesses that are individually registered for VAT in each specific EU country where they sell goods or services.
* **Who it's for:** Larger businesses or those who prefer (or are required) to manage separate VAT registrations in each EU country they operate in.
