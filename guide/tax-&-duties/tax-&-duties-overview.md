# Tax & Duties Overview

FluentCart’s **Tax & Duties** section is a powerful tool designed to help you manage your store’s taxes with ease and accuracy. Staying compliant with tax laws is essential for any business, and these settings give you the flexibility to handle everything from simple sales tax to complex international VAT rules.

Setting up your taxes is a straightforward, two-part process:

1.  **First, you set the global rules.** On the **Configuration & Classes** page, you will decide how taxes work across your entire store. This includes setting your main calculation rules and creating different tax classes for your products (e.g., standard rate, reduced rate, or tax-exempt).
2.  **Next, you set the specific rates.** On the **Rates** page, you will define the actual tax percentages for each country, state, or province you sell to.

This section contains two main guides to walk you through the entire setup:

* [**Configuring Tax Settings & Classes:**](/guide/tax-&-duties/configuration-and-classes.md) Learn how to set your store’s main tax rules, create tax classes for different product types, and configure EU VAT settings.
* [**Setting Up Tax Rates:**](/guide/tax-&-duties/tax-rates.md) Learn how to define the specific tax rates for each region you sell to and set up advanced rules like compound taxes and shipping tax overrides.

By following these guides, you can create a flexible and automated tax system that keeps your store compliant and your checkout process seamless for customers.
