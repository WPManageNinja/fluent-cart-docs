# Adding Percentage Type Coupons

Percentage type coupons provide a discount that is a percentage of the total order or eligible items (e.g., 10% off, 25% off). This guide will walk you through setting up a new percentage type coupon in FluentCart.

## Steps to Add a New Percentage Type Coupon

### 1. Basic Information

* **Title:** Enter an internal title for your coupon (e.g., "Black Friday 20% Off"). This is for your reference and not visible to customers.
* **Code:** This is the actual discount code that customers will enter at checkout (e.g., "BF20"). You can type a custom code or click **"Generate Random Code"** to create one automatically.
* **Coupon Priority:** (Optional) Enter a numerical value to set the priority of this coupon. A higher number might indicate a higher priority if multiple coupons can be applied.

### 2. Discount Value

* **Type:** Select **"Percentage"** from the dropdown menu.
* **Discount Percentage (%)\***: Enter the percentage value of the discount (e.g., "20" for 20% off).
* **Min Purchase Amount:** (Optional) Enter a minimum subtotal amount that the customer's cart must meet for the coupon to be valid. Default is $0.
* **Max Discount Amount:** (Optional) Enter a maximum monetary value for the discount. This is useful for percentage coupons to prevent excessively large discounts on very high-value orders. Default is $0 (no maximum).

### 3. Inclusion/Exclusion Rules (Optional)

You can define specific products or categories to which the coupon applies or is excluded from.

* **Include or exclude product categories:**
    * Choose **"Include"** or **"Exclude"** using the radio buttons.
    * Use the search field to select specific product categories.
* **Include or Exclude Products:**
    * Choose **"Include"** or **"Exclude"** using the radio buttons.
    * Click **"Select"** to search for and add specific products.

### 4. Schedule

Define when the coupon becomes active and when it expires.

* **Start Date & Time:** Set the date and time when the coupon becomes valid.
* **Set end date & time:** Check this box to enable an end date, then set the date and time when the coupon will expire.

### 5. Maximum Discount Uses

Control how many times the coupon can be used.

* **Total Limit:** Enter the maximum number of times this coupon can be used across all customers. Enter "0" for unlimited usage.
* **Per User Limit:** Enter the maximum number of times a single customer can use this coupon. Enter "0" for unlimited usage per user.

### 6. Additional Information

* **Status:** Set the coupon's status to **"Active"** to make it usable or **"Inactive"** to disable it.
* **Internal Notes:** (Optional) Add any private notes about the coupon for your own reference.
* **Stackable:** Choose **"Yes"** or **"No"** to determine if this coupon can be combined with other active coupons.

## Saving Your Coupon

Once all settings are configured, click the **"Save"** button at the top of the page (if visible, or "Update" if editing) to create or update your percentage type coupon.
