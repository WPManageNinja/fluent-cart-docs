# Purchase History

The **Purchase History** section provides a complete record of all your orders made through the FluentCart store. You can view detailed information about each transaction, including payment status and ordered items.

## Viewing All Purchases

When you go to the Purchase History page, you'll see a list of all your orders. Each row gives you a quick summary:

* **# (Order Number)**: This shows your unique order number and the date you placed the order.
* **Items**: Here you'll see a quick summary of the products included in that order.
* **Status**: A simple badge shows the current status, like **Completed**, **On-Hold**, or **Canceled**.
* **Amount**: This is the total price you paid for the order.

## Searching Your Orders

Have a lot of past orders? No problem. Use the **Search bar** (look for the magnifying glass icon) at the top-right of your order list to quickly find the purchase you're looking for.

* **Order Summary**: At the top of the page, you'll find a quick summary showing the product you bought, the total price, and a payment status like **Paid**.
