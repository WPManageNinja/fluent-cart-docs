# Subscriptions

The **Subscription Plans** tab in your account dashboard is your central hub for viewing and managing all of your active and past recurring subscriptions. This is where you can track renewal dates, update your payment information, and access the complete history of your subscription payments.

### Viewing All Your Subscriptions

The main Subscription Plans page displays a clear, organized list of all your subscriptions.

For each subscription, you can quickly see:

* **Item:** The name of the product and its specific plan.
* **Status:** The current status of the subscription (e.g., Active) and its next renewal date.
* **Plan:** The recurring cost and billing frequency (e.g., "$79.00 per year, until cancel.").
* **Payment Method:** The saved payment method used for automatic renewals (e.g., the last four digits of a credit card).
