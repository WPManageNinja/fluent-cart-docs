# Downloads

The **Downloads** section of your FluentCart Customer Profile provides a centralized place to access all digital products you have purchased. This includes software, e-books, templates, and any other downloadable content.

## How to Download Your Files

When you go to the Downloads page, you will see a simple list of all the files available to you. For each item, you'll see:

* **File Name:** This is the name of the downloadable file, like Creative_Stock_Pack_Subscription.pdf.
* **File Size:** Below the name, you can see the file size.
* **Download Button:** On the far right, there's a clear Download button.

To save a file to your computer, just click the **Download** button next to it. The download will start automatically. If you have many purchased files, you can navigate through them using the page numbers at the bottom of the list.
