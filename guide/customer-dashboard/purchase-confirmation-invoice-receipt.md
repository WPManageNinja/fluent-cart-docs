# Purchase Confirmation & Invoice Receipt

After completing a purchase, customers will be redirected to a **Purchase Successful** page. This page serves as the confirmation of their order and includes all essential details about the transaction, products, and billing information.

This page is only visible to customers after checkout, ensuring they can easily verify their purchase and access their invoice or downloads right away.

## Purchase Successful Page Overview

Once the order is placed, customers will see a confirmation message with a green success banner — indicating that the payment was processed successfully.

This page contains a clear summary of the order, including:

* **Customer Name:** The name of the customer who completed the purchase.
* **Order ID:** A unique identifier for the order (e.g., #INV-6).
* **Purchased Item(s):** A list of purchased products and their respective plans (e.g., FluentCRM – Solo/Blogger).
* **Price & Total:** The total purchase amount and payment method (e.g., VISA ending in 4242).
* **Subscription Details:** Information about renewal periods and next billing dates.
* **Downloads:** Direct download links for purchased digital files (e.g., fluentcampaign-pro.zip).
* **Licenses:** Displays license keys associated with the product.

### Invoice & Receipt Details

FluentCart automatically generates an invoice receipt for every order. This invoice acts as an official record of the transaction and can be easily accessed by the customer.

**What the Invoice Includes:**

* Customer name 
* Order ID and purchase date
* Product name and price breakdown
* Payment method used
* Total paid amount
* Renewal information (if it’s a subscription-based order)

This detailed invoice ensures that customers have all the necessary purchase information in one place.

### Downloading the Invoice Receipt

At the bottom of the **Purchase Successful** page, customers will find two key buttons:

* **View Order:** Opens the full order details inside their account dashboard.
* **Download Receipt:** Generates a PDF version of the official invoice that customers can save or print for their records.

This allows users to quickly access their payment confirmation and keep a digital copy for bookkeeping or support purposes.

### Accessing the Order Later

Customers can always revisit their order details later by logging into their account and navigating to:

**My Account → Purchse History**

From there, they can:

* Review past purchases
* Re-download invoice receipts
* Access licenses or digital downloads

### Summary

The **Purchase Confirmation & Invoice Receipt** page is designed to make the post-purchase experience transparent and simple.

It gives customers immediate access to their order summary, downloads, and receipts — helping build trust and ensuring smooth management of their purchases.
