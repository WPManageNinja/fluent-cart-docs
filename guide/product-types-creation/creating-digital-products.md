 # Creating Digital Products

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for adding a digital product to your FluentCart store.

A digital product is any file that customers can download after purchase, such as an e-book, software, music, or design template. FluentCart gives you all the tools to set up these items correctly.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

* Add product details and set a price.
* Upload the downloadable file for your customers.
* Manage different product variations if needed.

By the end, you will be able to confidently sell and manage any downloadable item.

## Steps to Create a New Digital Product

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Products** in the left WordPress sidebar.
2.  On the **Products** screen, click the **"Add Product"** button at the top right.

### Shipping Class

You can assign a **Shipping Class** to any product to apply location-based shipping costs.

To add a shipping class:

1. Scroll to the **Shipping Class** section (right side of the product edit screen).
2. Select or create a shipping class (e.g., *NYC Zone*).
3. The defined shipping cost will automatically apply at checkout for that region.

Shipping classes work with **Shipping Zones** and **Shipping Methods** to control how and where you deliver products.

> **Note:** Digital products typically donâ€™t require shipping, but you can still assign a class if needed for special handling or hybrid products.
