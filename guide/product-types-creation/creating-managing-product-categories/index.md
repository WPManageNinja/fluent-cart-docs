# Creating & Managing Product Categories

Product categories are the primary way to group and organize the products in your store. A well-structured set of categories makes it easy for customers to browse your offerings, find what they're looking for, and discover new items.

### Accessing Product Categories

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart**.
2.  In the left-hand menu, click on **Categories**.

This will take you to the main Categories screen, where you can add new categories and manage your existing ones.

### How to Add a New Product Category

On the left side of the Categories screen, you will find the form for adding a new category.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the fields:

* **Name:** Enter the name of your category as you want it to appear to customers on your storefront (e.g., "Digital Planners").
* **Slug:** This is the URL-friendly version of the name. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens. FluentCart will automatically create a slug from the name, but you can edit it if needed.
* **Parent Category:** This allows you to create a hierarchy of categories. For example, you could create a "Clothing" category and then create "T-Shirts" and "Hoodies" as child categories underneath it. To create a top-level category, leave this set to "None."
* **Description:** (Optional) You can add a short description for the category. Depending on your theme, this might be displayed at the top of the category page on your storefront.

After filling in the details, click the **Add New Category** button. Your new category will now appear in the list on the right.

### Managing Existing Categories

The table on the right side of the screen lists all your existing product categories. From here, you can quickly see the category's **Name, Description, Slug,** and a **Count** of how many products are in it.

To manage a category, hover your mouse over its name, and a set of action links will appear:

* **Edit:** Click this to open a dedicated editor for that category, where you can change its name, slug, parent, or description.
* **Quick Edit:** This allows you to make quick changes to the name and slug without leaving the main screen.
* **Delete:** This will permanently remove the category.
* **View:** This will take you to the public-facing category page on your storefront, showing all the products that belong to it.

You can also use the **Bulk Actions** dropdown menu at the top of the list to delete multiple categories at once.
