 # Creating Physical Products

Physical products are tangible goods that require shipping and inventory management. FluentCart provides a comprehensive interface to define all the necessary details for your physical products, including descriptions, pricing, variations, and stock levels.

## Steps to Create a New Physical Product

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Products** in the left sidebar.
2.  On the **Products** screen, click the **"Add Product"** button at the top right.

    * **Price:** The selling price for this particular variation (e.g., "$8.00").
    * **Compare at price:** (Optional) Enter a higher price that will be displayed as a strike-through price, indicating a discount or original price.

2.  Click the **"Update"** (or "Save") button on the top right to make your product live in your store.
