# Creating & Managing Product Brands

Product Brands in FluentCart are a great way to group products from the same manufacturer or brand together. This helps with store organization and allows customers to easily find and shop for all products from a brand they like. 

Properly assigning brands can significantly improve your store's navigation, enhance the customer's shopping experience, and even provide SEO benefits by creating brand-specific archive pages.

This guide will show you how to create, manage, and assign brands to your products.

## Creating a New Brand

To get started, you first need to create your brands. This process is straightforward and allows you to build out your brand library before assigning them to products.

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, go to **FluentCart Pro → Product Brands**.

2.  This will take you to the main Brands screen, where you will find a list of all your existing brands. To add a new one, click the **Add New Brand** button at the top right.

3.  An "Add New Brand" pop-up window will appear. Fill in the details for your brand:

    * **Name:** Enter the brand's name exactly as you want it to appear to your customers. This is the primary identifier for the brand.

    * **Slug:** This is the URL-friendly version of the name, used in the web address for the brand's archive page. It should be all lowercase and contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. FluentCart will often generate this automatically from the name, but you can customize it.

    * **Parent Brand:** This powerful feature allows you to create brand hierarchies. For example, if you sell a specific product line from a larger company, you could make "Air Jordan" a child of the "Nike" parent brand.

    * **Description:** Add a short description for the brand. Depending on your website's theme, this description may be displayed on the brand's archive page, providing customers with more context and improving SEO.

4.  Click the **Add New Brand** button to save the brand. It will now appear in your main brand list.

### Managing Existing Brands

The main **Product Brands** screen provides a central dashboard to manage all the brands you have created.

* The table displays each brand's **Name**, **Description**, **Slug**, and the **Count** of products assigned to it. This count is a useful way to see at a glance how popular each brand is in your store.

* Use the **Search** bar to quickly find a specific brand, which is especially helpful for stores with a large and growing catalog of brands.

* Click the **column icon** on the right to customize the table view. You can show or hide columns to declutter the interface and focus only on the information you need.

* Click the **sort icon** to organize the brand list by different criteria. For example, you can sort alphabetically by Name or numerically by Count to easily identify your most popular or unused brands.

#### Assigning Brands to a Product

Once your brands are created, you can assign them to your products.

1.  Navigate to the product you want to assign a brand to by going to **FluentCart Pro → Products** and clicking on a product to open its editor.

2.  On the product edit page, look for the **Product Taxonomies** section on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.  In the **Brands** box, you can assign one or more brands to the product:

    * Check the box next to any existing brand in the list.

    * Click the **+ Add Brand** link to create a new brand on the fly and assign it simultaneously, without needing to leave the product editor.

4.  After assigning the brand(s), click the **Update** or **Publish** button at the top right of the page to save your changes. The brand will now be associated with that product.
