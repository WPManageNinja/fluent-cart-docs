#### Additional Refund Analytics

Below the main chart, the report features additional sections for more granular analysis.

**Weeks between an order created date and refund date**

This bar chart helps you understand how quickly customers request refunds after their initial purchase. It groups refunds by the number of weeks that have passed between the order date and the refund date, which can help you identify if issues are appearing immediately or over time.

**Refund Grouped By**

This powerful section allows you to segment your refund data based on different criteria, helping you pinpoint the source of refunds.

* **Grouping Options:** Use the dropdown menu on the right to choose how you want to group the data. Common options include:
    * **Billing Country:** Segments refunds based on the customer's billing address to see if certain regions have higher refund rates.
* **Data Table:** The table will dynamically update to show a detailed breakdown of your refund data based on the selected grouping, including metrics like the number of Refunds, the total Refunded Amount, and the Average Refund for each item in the group (e.g., for each country).
* **Export:** Click the **Export** button to download the currently displayed grouped data as a CSV file.
