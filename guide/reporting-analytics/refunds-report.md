### Key Refund Metrics

At the top of the **Refunds Report**, you will find summary cards highlighting your key refund metrics for the selected period.

* **Total Refunds:** This figure displays the total number of individual refund transactions processed.
* **Total Refunded Amount:** This represents the total monetary value of all refunds issued to customers.

#### Refund Report Chart

The main visualization on this dashboard is the **Refund Report Chart**. This is a powerful area chart that allows for easy trend analysis of your refund activity. 

By showing the current period's refund data alongside the past, you can quickly identify spikes, measure the impact of changes, and see if your refund rate is improving or worsening. The chart displays key trends for **Total Refunded Amount** and the count of **Total Refunds**.

### Detailed Refund Analysis

Below the main chart, detailed breakdowns provide the specific data behind the visualization. This section is essential for granular analysis.

* **Weeks between an order created date and refund date:** This bar chart shows how much time passes before customers request refunds. It helps you understand if issues with a product are immediate or develop over time.

* **Refund Grouped By:** This table breaks down your refund data by different criteria, such as **Billing Country**. The columns show the number of **Refunds**, the total **Refunded Amount**, and the **Average Refund**. This helps you pinpoint if refunds are more common in specific regions or with certain customer segments.

The Refunds Report goes deeper than sales data, showing you the reasons behind customer returns so you can improve your products and services.
