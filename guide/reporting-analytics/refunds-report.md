### Key Refund Metrics

At the top of the **Refunds Report**, you will find summary cards highlighting your key refund metrics for the selected period.

* **Total Refunds:** This figure displays the total number of individual refund transactions processed.
* **Total Refunded Amount:** This represents the total monetary value of all refunds issued to customers.
* **Avg. Refunded Amount:** This calculates the average value of a single refund transaction.
* **Refund Rate:** This key metric shows the percentage of orders that resulted in a refund.

Each metric also includes a percentage that indicates the increase or decrease compared to the period you are comparing against.

#### Refund Report Chart

The main chart on this dashboard is the **Refund Report Chart**. It’s an area chart that makes it easy to see trends in your refunds.

The chart compares refunds from the current period with past refunds, so you can quickly see increases or decreases and track changes in your refund rate. It shows both **Total Refunded Amount** and **Total Refunds**

### Detailed Refund Analysis

Below the main chart, you’ll find more detailed breakdowns that show the data behind the charts. This helps you understand refunds in more detail.

* **Weeks between an order created date and refund date:** This bar chart shows how long it takes for customers to request refunds. It helps you see if problems happen right away or later.

* **Refund Grouped By:** This table breaks down refunds by things like **Billing Country**. It shows the number of **Refunds**, the total **Refunded Amount**, and the **Average Refund**, helping you find patterns in specific regions or customer groups.

The Refunds Report goes deeper than sales data, showing you the reasons behind customer returns so you can improve your products and services.
