# Orders Report

The **Orders Report** in FluentCart provides a deep dive into your store's order performance with in-depth analytics. This powerful dashboard allows you to analyze various aspects of your sales data through detailed charts and tables, helping you understand trends, customer behavior, and fulfillment efficiency.

#### Accessing the Orders Report

To find your Orders Report:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > [Reports](/guide/reporting-analytics/reports-dashboard-overview.md)**.
2. Click on the **Orders** tab to access the Orders Report.

#### Filtering the Report

The **Orders Report** includes the same simple filters you’ll find in other reports. These filters allow you narrow results to a specific time frame, compare different periods, or focus on particular order types. So, you can quickly get the exact data you need.

### Filtering by Date

You'll see a **Date** filter left at the top. This allows you to check your store’s performance for a specific period. You can pick from preset options or select a custom date range that you want to see.

### Comparing Time Periods

Next to the date filter, you'll find the **Compare to** filter. This is a powerful tool to see your growth. For example, you can compare this week's sales order to last week's to see if you're improving.

You can choose to compare your selected date range with:

* **Previous Period:** Compares to the immediately preceding period of the same length.
* **Previous Month:** Compares to the entire previous calendar month.
* **Previous Quarter:** Compares to the previous three-month quarter.
* **Previous Year:** Compares to the same date range in the previous year.
* **Custom:** Lets you select a custom date range to compare against.

### Using Advanced Filters

For a more detailed view, click the **Filter** icon in the top-right corner. This will open up advanced options to narrow down your report.

#### Filter by Order Type

This allows you to see data for specific kinds of orders. It's great for separating your one-time sales from your recurring revenue. You can filter by:

* **All:** Shows every type of order.
* **One time:** Shows only standard, one-time purchases.
* **Subscription:** Shows only new subscription orders.
* **Renewal:** Shows only recurring payments from existing subscriptions.

#### Filter by Products

If you want to see how many orders included a specific item, you can use this filter. Just start typing a product's name and select it from the list. You can select multiple products to see their combined order data.

#### Order Report Chart
