# Product Report

The **Product Report** provides detailed analytics on the performance of your individual products. This dashboard is essential for understanding which products are your bestsellers, tracking sales volume, and comparing performance over different time periods to identify trends.

#### Accessing the Product Report

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Reports**.
2.  Click on the **Product** tab to access the Product Report.

#### Filtering the Report

To help you analyze your data effectively, the Product Report includes several filtering options:

* **Date Filter:** Located at the top of the page, this allows you to view data for a specific timeline, such as "This Month," "This Year," or a custom date range. All charts and metrics on the page will update based on your selection.
* **Advanced Filters:** To the top right, click the **filter icon** to segment the report by **Order Status** or **Payment Status**, allowing you to focus on product performance from specific types of orders.

#### Product Report Chart

The main chart at the top of the page visually represents your key product performance trends over the selected period.

* **Metric Selector:** In the top right corner of the chart, you can use the dropdown menu to select which metrics are displayed.
* **Interactive Controls:** You can also interact with the chart using the icons to zoom in on specific periods or download the chart as an image for your records.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To the right of the main chart, you will find a summary of crucial product-related metrics for the selected period.

* **Units Sold:** This is the total quantity of all product units sold.
* **Gross Sale:** This represents the total revenue generated from product sales before any deductions.
* **Customer Count:** This shows the total number of unique customers who purchased products.
* **Avg. Selling Price:** This calculates the average price of the products sold.

#### Product Performance Comparison

This powerful section allows you to compare the sales data of your products over two different time periods, helping you to measure growth and identify trends.

1.  **Select Time Periods:** Use the two sets of dropdown menus to select the time periods you want to compare (e.g., "This Month" vs. "Last Month").
2.  **View Comparison Data:** The table will then display a side-by-side comparison for each product, showing metrics like sales and revenue for both selected periods, making it easy to spot which products are trending up or down.
