* **Compare To:** This dropdown allows you to choose a past time period to compare with your current data.
* **Advanced Filters:** Click the filter icon to break down the report by options like Order Type or specific Products. This helps you focus on detailed product data for a closer view.

#### Product Report Chart

This chart gives you a picture of your overall product performance, visually comparing sales between two different time periods.

* **Current Range:** Represented by the blue area, this shows performance for the period you selected.
* **Compare Range:** Represented by the green area, this shows performance for the historical period you are comparing against.

### Product Performance Comparison

Below the main chart, a detailed comparison table allows you to analyze the performance of individual products between two specific months. Then, the table will then show:

* **Product:** This column lists your individual products.
* **Comparison:** This unique column uses a bar chart to visually compare the sales numbers for each of the two months you selected, making it easy to see which products are trending up or down.
* **Change:** This column shows the exact percentage of change between the two months, color-coded for a quick view of performance.
