## Key Product Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The top section of the Product Report provides a summary of crucial product-related metrics:

* **Units Sold:** The total number of individual product units sold.
* **Customer Count:** The total number of customers who purchased products.
* **Gross Sales:** The total value of sales before any deductions.
* **Avg. Selling Price:** The average selling price of all products.

## Product Report Chart

This chart shows a picture of how your product sales trends have changed over time. You can choose to see data on a "Monthly" or "Yearly" timeline. (Please note: In the example screenshot, the chart might appear empty if there's no data yet, but its purpose is to show these trends.)

## Product Performance Comparison ##

This important section allows you to compare the performance of your products over different time periods.

You can select **Year** and **Month** for two different periods to compare them side-by-side. For example, you might compare sales from "Year 2024, Month May" against "Year 2025, Month May" to see how your products are doing year-over-year or month-over-month.

## Search Filter (Available Across All Reports)

A general **"Search Filter"** is available at the top of the Product Report, which is also present across all other report types in FluentCart. This allows you to quickly find specific data within the report.
