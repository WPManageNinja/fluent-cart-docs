## Reports Dashboard Overview (The Summary Page)

When you first enter the Reports section, you land on the **Overview** tab. This tab is your main summary page, built to give you the most important information about your store's status and momentum instantly.

### Reporting Overview - Gross Summary

At the very top, you get a direct summary of your store's financial volume and growth:

* **Gross Volume:** The total sales amount before anything is taken out, charted over specific periods (e.g., quarterly or monthly).
* **Year-over-Year Growth (YoY):** This figure shows the percentage change in your gross volume compared to the same time last year, giving you crucial context on expansion.

### Key Performance Trends

The middle section presents key visual trends that inform your business strategy:

* **Gross Volume Breakdown:** Charts showing the historical trend of your raw sales, helping you spot seasonal patterns and monitor the overall flow of revenue.
* **Stock Trend Overview:** This essential graph tracks sales performance against your current inventory levels. It helps you quickly identify your fastest-moving stock and prevent potential shortages.

### Core Revenue and Geographic Metrics

These sections move beyond raw sales to show real profitability and market performance:

* **Net Revenue:** Your true total income after all costs, refunds, and discounts have been removed. This figure shows the store’s actual profitability.
* **Net Revenue Quarterly:** The net income broken down by three-month periods for easier fiscal review.
* **Top Country Gross/Net Volume:** Visual charts that categorize your sales and revenue based on the customer’s billing country. This helps you identify your most valuable geographical markets.

### Product and Customer Value

The final charts focus on catalog performance and the health of your customer base:

* **Top Product Sales Distribution:** Graphs detailing how sales volume is distributed across your entire catalog, helping you see which products are driving the most volume.
* **Customer LifeTime Value (CLTV):** Metrics showing the expected total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship with your store, which is key for marketing decisions.

By reviewing the Overview first, you get a clean summary of the most critical numbers, allowing you to choose which detailed tab (Sales, Refunds, etc.) you need to investigate further.
