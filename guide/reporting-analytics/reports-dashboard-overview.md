 # Reports Dashboard Overview

The main Reports Dashboard in FluentCart gives you a clear and quick look at your store's sales and income. It helps you understand your finances at a glance, with a focus on volume and growth.

## Accessing the Reports Dashboard

1. Go to your WordPress dashboard, then go to **FluentCart Pro** > **Reports** in the top menu bar.
2. When you open the Reports screen, you'll automatically be on the **Overview** tab. This tab is your main summary page.

## Reporting Overview - Gross Summary

At the very top of this overview, you'll see a summary of your gross sales volume for key periods. For example, it might tell you:

* **Gross Volume for a Quarter:** The total sales amount before anything is taken out, for a specific three-month period.
* **Year-over-Year Growth:** How much this gross volume has changed compared to the same time last year.
It also shows what's left for the current quarter and how the current gross volume compares to previous periods.

## Gross Volume Breakdown

This section provides a table that breaks down your gross sales volume, often showing growth percentages.

* **Volume ($):** This column shows the total money earned from sales (before any costs or refunds).
* **YoY Growth (%):** This shows the percentage of growth compared to the same time in the previous year.
