### Detailed Subscription Analysis

Below the main comparison, youâ€™ll find detailed charts that show customer loyalty and new customer trends. This section helps you clearly see how healthy your subscription business is.

* **Retention Chart:** This chart shows you how long your customers stay subscribed after their initial purchase. The horizontal axis is divided into time periods like 7 Days, 30 Days, and 180 Days, making it easy to see at which point customers are most likely to drop off. This is a key tool for measuring customer loyalty.

* **Daily Signups:** This chart tracks the number of new subscriptions you get each day. It helps you visualize your daily growth and identify trends in customer acquisition, which can be useful for seeing the impact of marketing campaigns.

With the Subscription Report, you can easily see patterns in your subscription signups, giving you the insights you need to measure your growth.
