# Sales Report

The **Sales Report** provides a clear and comprehensive overview of your store's performance, helping you track key metrics and understand your sales trends at a glance. This dashboard is designed to give you actionable insights into your revenue, orders, and customer behavior.

#### Accessing the Sales Report

To get to your Sales Report:

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Reports**.
2.  Click on the **Sales** tab. This is where you'll find the main sales dashboard.

### Filtering Your Report Data

Want to look at a specific time frame? Or maybe you want to see how your sales this month compare to last month? FluentCart makes this easy with simple filtering tools.

### Filtering by Date

You'll see a **Date** filter right at the top. This lets you check your store’s performance for a specific period. You can pick from preset options or select a custom date range that you want to see.

### Comparing Time Periods

Next to the date filter, you'll find the **Compare to** filter. This is a powerful tool to see your growth. For example, you can compare this week's sales to last week's to see if you're improving.

You can choose to compare your selected date range with:

* **Previous Period:** Compares to the immediately preceding period of the same length.
* **Previous Month:** Compares to the entire previous calendar month.
* **Previous Quarter:** Compares to the previous three-month quarter.
* **Previous Year:** Compares to the same date range in the previous year.
* **Custom:** Lets you select a custom date range to compare against.

### Using Advanced Filters

For a deeper dive into your sales, look for the filter icon in the top-right corner of the report. Clicking this opens up advanced filtering options so you can get very specific with your data.

#### Filter by Order Type

Want to know how much revenue comes from new subscriptions compared to one-time purchases? This filter makes it easy. You can choose to view data for:

 * **All:** Shows every type of order.
 * **One time:** Shows only standard, one-time purchases.
 * **Subscription:** Shows only initial subscription sign-ups.
 * **Renewal:** Shows only recurring subscription payments.

#### Filter by Products

Do you want to check the performance of a specific product? This filter is for you. Simply click on the **search box** and start typing the name of a product. You can select one or more products from the list to see their combined sales data. This is great for tracking how a newly launched item is doing or checking on your bestsellers.

When you use any of these filters, all the numbers and charts on the page will instantly update to show you exactly the information you asked for. Also, you can reset your filter by clicking the **Reset Filter** button.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the report, you'll see a row of **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. These are the most important numbers that give you a quick summary of your store's health for the time period you've selected.

* **Gross Sales:** This is the total amount of money you've made from sales before any deductions like refunds.
* **Refunded:** The total amount of money that has been returned to customers as refunds.
* **Net Revenue:** This is your true income—what’s left after refunds have been subtracted from your Gross Sales. 
* **Orders:** The total number of orders that have been placed in your store.
* **Items Sold:** The total number of individual products that have been sold. 
* **Total Refunds:** The total count of individual refund transactions that were processed.

Each KPI also shows a percentage in red or green. This tells you how that number has changed compared to the previous period you are comparing it to. It’s a quick way to see if you are growing or slowing down!

#### Report Sections

Below the KPIs, the dashboard is divided into several sections that offer more detailed insights.

* **Top Sold Products:** This section lists your best-selling products based on the number of units sold and the revenue they have generated. This helps you quickly identify your most popular items.
* **Top Sold Variants:** Similar to the above, this section breaks down sales by specific product variations (e.g., "T-Shirt, Blue, Large"). This provides granular insight into which specific options are the most popular with your customers.
* **Failed Orders:** This section displays a list of orders that were initiated but not successfully completed. This can help you identify potential issues in your checkout process. You can click the **View All Orders** button to see a complete list of these transactions.
