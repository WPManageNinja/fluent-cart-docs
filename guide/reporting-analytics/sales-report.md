## Top Sold Products

This section lists your products that sold the most items. It helps you quickly identify your most popular items based on the number of units sold and the revenue they generated.

## Top Sold Variants

Similar to top-selling products, this section breaks down sales by specific versions of your products (like different colors or sizes). This gives you even more specific ideas about which exact variations are selling best.

## Failed Orders

This section shows orders that did not finish. It helps you keep track of purchases that customers tried to make but didn't go through.

## Search Filter (Available Across All Reports)

A general **"Search Filter"** is at the top of the Sales Report. It's also on all other report types in FluentCart. This helps you quickly find specific facts within the report.
