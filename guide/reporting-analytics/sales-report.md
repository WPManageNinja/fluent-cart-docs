# Sales Report

The **Sales Report** provides a clear and comprehensive overview of your store's performance, helping you track key metrics and understand your sales trends at a glance. This dashboard is designed to give you actionable insights into your revenue, orders, and customer behavior.

#### Accessing the Sales Report

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro > Reports**.
2.  The **Sales** tab is displayed by default, showing you the main sales dashboard.

#### Filtering the Report

FluentCart provides powerful filtering options to help you drill down into your sales data and analyze specific segments of your store's performance.

**Advanced Status Filters**

To the top right of the report, you will find an **advanced filter icon**. Clicking this reveals options to segment your report data by status, allowing you to isolate and analyze orders based on their current stage in the lifecycle.

* **Order Status:** This filter segments the report based on the fulfillment status of an order. For example, selecting "Completed" will show you the revenue and KPIs generated only from orders that have been fully processed and fulfilled. The available options are:
    * All
    * Processing
    * Completed
    * On Hold
    * Canceled
    * Failed
* **Payment Status:** This filter segments the report based on the financial status of an order. For instance, selecting "Paid" will show you the metrics for all orders that have been successfully paid for, regardless of whether they are still processing or have been completed. The available options are:
    * All
    * Paid
    * Pending
    * Partially Paid

**Filtering by Date**

Below the main tabs, you will find a **Date** filter. This allows you to analyze your store's performance over a specific period. You can select a predefined range (like "Last 7 Days" or "This Month") or choose a custom date range.

When you apply any of these filters, all KPIs and report sections on the page will update to reflect your selection.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The top of the dashboard displays a series of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide a high-level summary of your store's activity for the selected date range.

* **Net Revenue:** The total income earned after deducting refunds, discounts, and coupon codes. This represents the true revenue your store has generated.
* **Orders:** The total number of successful orders placed.
* **New Customers:** The number of new customers who made their first purchase.
* **Items Sold:** The total quantity of all product units sold.
* **Refunded:** The total monetary value of all refunds processed.
* **Total Refunds:** The total number of individual refund transactions.
* **Average Order Net:** The average revenue earned per order (Net Revenue divided by Orders).
* **Average Order Items:** The average number of items purchased in each order.
* **Average Customer Orders:** The average number of orders placed per customer.
* **Average Customer LTV (Lifetime Value):** The average total revenue generated per customer over their entire history with your store.

#### Report Sections

Below the KPIs, the dashboard is divided into several sections that offer more detailed insights.

* **Top Sold Products:** This section lists your best-selling products based on the number of units sold and the revenue they have generated. This helps you quickly identify your most popular items.
* **Top Sold Variants:** Similar to the above, this section breaks down sales by specific product variations (e.g., "T-Shirt, Blue, Large"). This provides granular insight into which specific options are the most popular with your customers.
* **Failed Orders:** This section displays a list of orders that were initiated but not successfully completed. This can help you identify potential issues in your checkout process. You can click the **View All Orders** button to see a complete list of these transactions.
