### Key Revenue Metrics

The top of the report displays a high-level summary of your store's financial activity. Each metric provides the total value for the selected date range, along with a visual indicator of its performance compared to the period selected in the "Compare to" filter.

* **Gross Sales:** This represents the total revenue from all sales before any deductions are made. The percentage and trend arrow icon (▲ or ▼) next to the value show the increase or decrease compared to the comparison period.
* **Refund:** This displays the total monetary value of refunds processed. Similarly, the percentage and trend arrow show how the total refund amount has changed relative to the comparison period.
* **Revenue:** This shows your total income after deductions like refunds have been subtracted. The percentage and trend arrow provide a direct comparison of your net revenue between the two selected periods.
