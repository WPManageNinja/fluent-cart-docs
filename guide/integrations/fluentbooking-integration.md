# FluentBooking Integration

Connecting **FluentCart** with **FluentBooking** turns your appointment calendar into a powerful sales channel. This integration allows you to sell consultations, classes, services, or products directly through your booking forms without requiring third-party plugins.

By using FluentCart’s payment processing, you can maintain a unified ecosystem for both your products and your scheduled appointments.

## Step 1: Activate the FluentCart Module

The connection between the two plugins is designed to be seamless. Once FluentCart is active on your site, you simply need to toggle the feature inside FluentBooking.

1.  Navigate to **FluentBooking > Settings** from your WordPress dashboard.
2.  Click on **Advanced Features & Addons** in the top menu bar.
3.  The system should automatically detect the FluentCart plugin; ensure it is enabled to allow the two tools to communicate.

## Step 2: Link a Product to Your Calendar

After the module is active, you can decide which specific booking events should require payment.

1.  Go to the **Booking Calendars** section in FluentBooking.
2.  Click **Edit** on an existing event, or create a **+ New event**.

3.  Select **Payment Settings** from the left sidebar.
4.  Check the box labeled **Enable this payment as Paid and collect payment on booking**.
5.  In the **Payment Method** dropdown, choose **FluentCart Checkout**.
6.  **Select a Product:** Choose the appropriate FluentCart product from the dropdown list.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** If you haven't created the product yet, click the **+ New** button to create it instantly from this screen.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the free version of FluentBooking, you can link only one product per event.

## Step 3: Handle Multiple Durations (Optional)

If your booking event offers different time lengths (e.g., a 30-minute vs. a 60-minute session), you can assign a unique product and price to each duration. Click **Save Changes** to finalize your setup.

## The Customer Experience

When your clients book an appointment, the integration handles the entire transaction:

* **Transparent Pricing:** The price of the linked FluentCart product is displayed directly on your booking form.
* **Secure Checkout:** After picking a time slot, the user is redirected to the FluentCart checkout page to pay.
* **Instant Confirmation:** Once the payment is finished, the booking is processed, and the transaction is recorded via your chosen FluentCart payment gateway.

## Managing Your Data

One of the biggest benefits of this integration is that it keeps your records centralized:

* **In FluentBooking:** View all appointment details and schedules in the **Bookings** section.
