# Integrations & Addons

The **Integrations & Addons** screen is your central hub for connecting FluentCart with other powerful plugins and services. By activating these modules, you can automate your marketing, improve email deliverability, enhance customer support, and extend the functionality of your e-commerce store.

This guide will walk you through the two main sections of this page: **Global Integrations Feeds** and **Integration Modules**.

## Accessing the Integrations & Addons

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro**.
2.  In the left-hand menu, click on **Integrations**.

### Global Integrations Feeds

This section, located at the top of the page, is where you create powerful, store-wide automation rules. A "feed" is a rule that is triggered by an event in your store (like a new order) and performs an action in another integrated service (like adding a customer to a list in FluentCRM).

These integration rules apply globally to all your orders. For more targeted rules, you can also set up integrations on a [per-product basis](/guide/product-types-creation/managing-product-integrations.md).

### Integration Modules

This section, located at the bottom of the page, is where you manage the connections between FluentCart and other plugins. Before you can use an integration, you must first enable its module here.

#### Activating an Integration Module

The activation process is largely automatic.

* **If the required plugin is already installed and active:** FluentCart will automatically detect it, and you will see a green **Enabled** status badge. The integration is ready to be used.
* **If the required plugin is not installed:** You will see a button like **Install FluentCommunity**. Clicking this will help you install and activate the necessary plugin. Once the plugin is active, the integration will automatically be enabled on this screen.

To help you find what you need, you can also use the filter tabs (**ALL, CRM, LMS, CORE, MARKETING**) or the search bar to find a specific module.
