# Integrations Overview

**Integrations** are the key to unlocking the full power of your store. By connecting FluentCart with other powerful tools and services, you can automate your marketing, smooth your workflow, and add new capabilities to your e-commerce business.

This guide provides an overview of the available integration modules and explains how to activate and configure them.

## Accessing the Main Integration Modules

Many of FluentCart's core integrations can be found in a central dashboard, making them easy to manage.

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **FluentCart Pro**.
2.  In the left-hand menu, click on **Integrations**.

On this screen, you will see all the available integration modules for your FluentCart store. To help you find what you need, you can use the filter tabs (**ALL, CRM, LMS, CORE**) at the top of the list or use the search bar to find a specific integration by name.

## Activating an Integration

For each module, you will see its current status displayed next to its name. The activation process is largely automatic.

* **If the required plugin is already installed and active:** FluentCart will automatically detect it, and you will see a green **Enabled** status badge. The integration is ready to be configured.
* **If the required plugin is not installed:** You will see a button like **Install FluentCommunity**. Clicking this will help you install and activate the necessary plugin. Once the plugin is active, the integration will automatically be enabled on this screen.
