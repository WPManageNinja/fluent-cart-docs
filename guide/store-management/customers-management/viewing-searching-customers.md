 # Viewing & Searching Customers

The customers list in FluentCart provides an organized overview of all individuals who have interacted with your store. This guide will show you how to navigate this list and effectively use search and filtering options to find specific customer profiles.

## Accessing the Customers List

In your WordPress dashboard, go to **FluentCart Pro** > **Customers** from the left-hand menu. This will open the **Customers** page, where youâ€™ll see a table with all your registered customers.

## Understanding the Customers List Table

The Customers list table presents key information for each customer at a glance:

* **Customer:** Displays the customer's name and their associated email address. 
* **Address:** Shows a summarized address for the customer. 
* **Purchases:** The total number of times they've bought something from your store.
* **LTV (Lifetime Value):** This shows the total amount of money a customer has spent in your store over their entire history. It helps you quickly identify your most valuable customers. 
* **Last Purchase Date:** Shows the date and time of their most recent purchase. 
* **Customer Since:** Displays the date and time when the customer's record was first created in your system.

## Finding Specific Customers

Need to find a specific person? The search bar at the top of the page makes it fast and easy.

Simply type what you're looking for into the search bar. You can search by a customer's **ID**, **First Name**, **Last Name**, or **Email Address**. Hit **Enter**, and the list will instantly filter to show you the results.

## Browsing Through Pages

If you have a lot of customers, you'll see page controls at the bottom of the table. You can use these to browse through different pages or change how many customers are shown on each page (e.g., 10 per page).
