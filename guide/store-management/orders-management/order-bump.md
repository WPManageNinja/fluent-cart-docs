# Order Bump

The **Order Bump** feature in FluentCart allows you to present a last-minute, complementary product offer directly on the checkout page. This simple, high-converting technique encourages customers to add an extra item to their cart before completing their purchase, significantly increasing your average order value (AOV).

## 1. Enabling the Order Bump Feature

Before you can create any order bumps, you must first activate the feature in your store settings.

1.  Go to **FluentCart Pro** in your WordPress dashboard.
2.  Navigate to **Settings** from the left-hand menu.
3.  Click on the **Features & Addon** tab.
4.  Locate the **Order Bump** toggle and switch it to **Active**.
5.  Click the **Save Settings** button to confirm the change.

### 2. Creating a New Order Bump Offer

Once the feature is active, you can create and manage your offers.

1.  Navigate to the main FluentCart Pro menu.
2.  Hover over the **More** menu item in the top navigation bar.
3.  Click on **Order Bump**. This will take you to the Order Bumps management screen.
4.  Click the **Add New** button on the top right to create a new offer. A pop-up window will appear where you need to define the initial details of your offer.

5.  To start creating your new offer, you must first define its core identity:

    * **Bump Name:** Enter the main title for your offer. This is the compelling headline that customers will see, so make it attractive.
    * **Order Bump Product:** From the dropdown menu, select the product that you want to offer as the order bump.

Click the **Create** button.

After clicking "Create," you will be taken to the main configuration screen to set up the rest of your order bump's rules and design.

### 3. Configuring the Order Bump Details

The Order Bump configuration screen is broken down into simple, manageable steps:

#### **A. Basic Info**

* **Enable this Order Bump:** Toggle this switch to instantly turn the offer on or off without deleting the configuration.
* **Bump Title:** This is the headline that captures the customerâ€™s attention at checkout (e.g., "Get this magic offer in 50% discount").
* **Bump Description:** Add a short, exciting description or a compelling reason why the customer should take the offer.

#### **B. Promotional Product**

* **Select Product:** Choose the specific product you want to offer as the bump. This item will be added to the customer's cart if they accept the offer.

#### **C. Discount**

* **Discount Amount:** Define the savings for this bump product. You can set the discount as a fixed amount or a **Percentage**.
* **Enable Coupon Discount on top of offer discount:** This option determines if other global coupons applied to the main cart can also be stacked on top of the Order Bump discount.
* **Free shipping for this offer item:** If desired, you can enable free shipping specifically for the bump product.

#### **D. Display Conditions (Detailed)**

This is the crucial step where you define exactly when and for whom this offer appears at checkout using conditional logic.

* **Enable Conditions for this Order Bump:** Check this box to activate the conditional logic.
* **Adding Conditions:** You can stack multiple conditions using dropdown menus to create precise rules based on cart content and value:
    * **Cart Items:** Check if a specific product (**Fleece Jacket**) **Exists** or doesn't exist in the customer's cart.
    * **Items Subtotal:** Set a threshold for the cart value (e.g., **Items Subtotal** is **Greater Than $30**).
* **Adding Condition Groups:** The **Add New Condition Group** button allows you to set up separate, alternative sets of rules (OR logic). The bump will display if *any* of the defined groups' conditions are met.

#### **E. Priority**

* **Set Priority:** If you have multiple Order Bumps active with overlapping display conditions, the priority number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) determines which offer will be displayed first. **Lower numbers mean higher priority.**

After configuring all the details, click **Save** (standard practice) to activate your bump offer.


### 4. Managing and Viewing Order Bumps

On the main **Order Bumps** screen, you can manage all your existing offers:

* **Status Tags:** Quickly see which offers are **Active**, **Draft** (saved but not enabled), or **All**.
* **Action Menu:** The vertical ellipsis (`...`) icon provides options to **Delete** an existing bump offer.

* **Checkout View:** Once active, the offers appear on your store's checkout page, clearly labeled (e.g., **Recommended**) with the title, description, and discount, ready for the customer to accept with a single click.
