### 1. Products 

This is the main tool for building your shop pages using the WordPress block editor. It displays your inventory in a professional grid layout.

### 2. Product Title 

This block displays the name of your product, pulling data automatically to keep your page accurate. It is a standalone tool, allowing you to place and style the title independently in your custom designs. Here you control how your product name behaves in the editor.

  * **Settings:** Toggle Make title a link if you want customers to be able to click the product name to visit its specific page. You can also enable Open in new tab so customers don't lose the page they are currently browsing.
  * **Typography & Alignment:** Use the block toolbar or sidebar to change the text alignment, adjust the font size, and pick a color that matches your brand.
  * **Additional CSS Class(es):** Enter custom code here if you want to add unique styling or specific font effects to the product title.

### 3. Product Search 

The Product Search block helps customers quickly find specific items in your store. Instead of browsing through many products, users can simply type what they’re looking for and get instant results.

You can add this block from the editor by selecting the magnifying glass icon under the FluentCart section.

**Block Settings:** When you click on the search bar in your editor, the right-hand sidebar gives you several options to control how the search behaves:

 * **Searchbar Behavior:** Choose whether search results open in a New Tab or the Current Tab.
 * **Category Filtering:** Enable this option to allow customers to filter their search by product categories.
 * **Link With Shop App:** Turn this on to connect the search bar with your Shop App settings for a more integrated experience.
 * **Advanced Settings:** Standard block options for layout and design customization.
 * **Additional CSS Class(es):** Add custom CSS classes if you want to modify the search bar’s style, such as colors, borders, or width.

### 4. Product Carousel 

The Product Carousel block is a dynamic tool for highlighting your best-selling or newest items in an interactive, sliding row. It is perfect for homepages or landing pages where you want to showcase multiple products in a limited space without overwhelming your shoppers.

  * **Product Selection:** Click the Select Product button to search for and pick the specific items you want to feature. You can easily manage your choices under the Selected products list.
  * **Layout:** Use the Slides per view slider to decide exactly how many products sit side-by-side on the screen at one time (for example, setting it to 4).
  * **Behavior:** This section gives you full control over the movement. You can toggle Autoplay for automatic sliding, enable an Infinite loop for continuous scrolling, and choose to Show arrows or Show Pagination (using styles like Fraction or Dots) to help customers navigate through your items.

  * **Additional CSS Class(es):** Enter custom code here if you want to add unique styling, like specialized borders or shadow effects, to the carousel container.

> **Tip:** Use the Product Carousel block at the top of your homepage to highlight your best-selling items with high-quality imagery to grab attention immediately.

### 5. Customer Dashboard 

This block is the "home base" for your customers. It acts as a personalized portal where they can manage every part of their relationship with your store, from viewing past orders to updating their own addresses.

**Settings:** Here you can place the dashboard on any page to give your users instant access to their account.

**Layout:** In the editor, you will see the dashboard organized with a clean sidebar menu that helps customers navigate between different sections like their Purchase History, Licenses, and Downloads.

> **Setup Tip:** For this block to work correctly, you must ensure you have assigned the Customer Dashboard page under **FluentCart Pro > Settings > Pages Setup**.

**Key Sections Your Customers Will See:**

  * **Purchase History:** A complete list of all past orders including unique identifiers like #INV-6, the date of purchase, and the current status (such as "Completed" or "Processing").
  * **Subscription Plans:** A dedicated area where customers can view their active or canceled recurring plans and check upcoming renewal dates.
  * **Managing Licenses:** Perfect for digital products, this section lets users see their license keys and how many sites they are currently using them on.
  * **Downloads:** A central place for customers to find every digital file they have bought, such as e-books or software updates.
  * **Profile & Address Settings:** This allows shoppers to keep their contact information and shipping addresses up-to-date without needing to contact your support team.

### 6. Product Card 

If you want to highlight one specific item on a special page—like a "Deal of the Day"—the Product Card block is the perfect tool. It puts a single product into a beautiful, standalone card that includes the featured image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button all in one neat package.

You can find this block in the FluentCart section of your editor, represented by a small card icon.

**Block Settings:** Here you can control exactly which product shows up and how the card is sized.

  * **Product Selection:** Use the Product dropdown to search for and pick the specific item you want to feature.
  * **Query type:** This determines how the block pulls information; leaving it on Default is usually best for a single card.
  * **Price Format:** You can set the price to show as "Starts From," which is very helpful if the product has different versions with different prices.
  * **Card Sizing:** You can fully control the size by choosing Custom Width and using the slider to make the card wider or narrower to fit your layout (e.g., setting it to 216 pixels).

  * **Additional CSS Class(es):** Enter custom code here if you want to add unique styling, like special shadows or borders, to your product card.
