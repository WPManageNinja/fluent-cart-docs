### Understanding the Core Blocks

FluentCart provides a comprehensive suite of blocks designed to help you build everything from a high-converting main shop page to highly customized product landing pages. These blocks are modular, allowing you to drag and drop elements exactly where you need them.

#### Store-wide & Navigation Blocks

These blocks form the backbone of your store, handling how users browse products and manage their accounts.

* **Product Title:** Displays the name of your product. This is a standalone block, allowing you to place and style the title independently in your custom designs.
* **Product Image:** Renders the featured image of your product. It provides a simple way to place the main product visual anywhere in your layout.
* **Products:** The primary block for your shop. It displays a dynamic grid of products that you can filter by category, tag, or status.
* **Product Carousel:** A dynamic slider block that showcases your products in a rotating carousel. Perfect for "Featured" sections or "New Arrivals" on your homepage.
* **Product Search:** Adds a specialized search bar that searches exclusively within your FluentCart product catalog.
* **Mini Cart:** A compact cart widget for your header or sidebar. It allows shoppers to quickly peek at their items, view the total price, and see the item count without leaving their current page.
* **Product Categories List:** Displays a organized list of your product categories, making it easy for customers to navigate different departments of your store.
* **Customer Dashboard:** A dedicated block for the "My Account" area where customers can view orders, manage subscriptions, and update their profile.
* **Checkout Page:** The essential block that renders the secure checkout form for completing purchases.

#### Single Product Modular Blocks

Use these blocks to build custom layouts for individual products or landing pages. They automatically pull data from the product they are assigned to.

* **Product Card:** Displays a specific product in a visually appealing standalone card format.
* **Product Info:** Renders the core details of a product, such as the Title and Short Description.
* **Price Range:** Displays the price or price range (for variable products) with automatic currency formatting.
* **Excerpt:** Shows a brief snippet or summary of the product description.
* **Buy Section:** The functional hub of a product page, containing variation selectors (Size, Color), quantity input, and the "Add to Cart" button.
* **Stock:** Displays the current inventory status (e.g., "In Stock" or "Out of Stock") to provide clarity to shoppers.

#### Call to Action Blocks

These focused blocks are designed to be placed anywhere on your site to trigger an immediate purchase action.

* **Buy Now:** A direct action button that can be configured to trigger the Instant Checkout (modal) or lead directly to the checkout page for a specific product.
* **Add to Cart:** A standalone button that adds a specific product or variation to the customer's cart while keeping them on the same page.

#### Customizing Your Blocks

Every FluentCart block features a **Settings Sidebar** on the right side of the WordPress editor. For example:

* **Mini Cart Settings:** You can choose your preferred icon (Cart, Bag, etc.), toggle the "Total Price" display, and decide when to show the item count (Always, Only if items exist, or Never).
* **Product Categories Settings:** You can toggle the display style between a list or dropdown and choose to show or hide the product counts for each category.

> **Tip:** Use the Product Carousel block at the top of your homepage to highlight your best-selling items with high-quality imagery to grab attention immediately.


> **Note:** Each FluentCart block comes with its own customization settings. After adding a block, check the settings panel on the right to adjust design, alignment, behavior, and visibility.
