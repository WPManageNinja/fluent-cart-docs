## Theme & Page Builder Compatibility

FluentCart is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and compatible with the vast majority of modern, well-coded WordPress themes and page builders. Our goal is to give you the freedom to choose the design and tools that you love, without being locked into a specific look.

Because FluentCart leverages native WordPress features like blocks and shortcodes, it integrates seamlessly into most environments.

## Officially Compatible Themes & Page Builders

While FluentCart should work well with almost any standard theme, we have officially tested and confirmed full compatibility with the following popular themes and page builders:

#### Popular Page Builders & Frameworks:

* Bricks
* Gutenberg

#### Popular Modern & Block-Based Themes:
* Divi
* Kadence
* Astra
* GeneratePress
* Blocksy
* Twenty Twenty-Five (and other default WordPress themes)
* Storefront
* OceanWP
* Hello Elementor
* FSE Block Theme

### What If My Theme Isn't on the List?

If your theme is not on this list, it is still very likely to be compatible with FluentCart, especially if it follows standard WordPress development practices.

FluentCart is built to be as theme-agnostic as possible. For any theme, you can use our powerful [**FluentCart Blocks**](/guide/customization-and-themes/using-fluentcart-blocks-&-templates.md) in the WordPress editor or place our [**shortcodes**](/guide/settings-configuration/pages-setup.md) to display products, checkout forms, and customer dashboards. This ensures that you can build a fully functional and beautiful storefront, no matter which theme you choose.
