# Layout and Template Customization (Block Editor)

FluentCart allows for deep customization of your store's design. Whether you are using the native WordPress Block Editor, a Block Theme, or a third-party page builder, you have flexible tools to control exactly how your products appear.

## Advanced Layout Control: A Practical Example

The Products block is not just a static grid—it's a flexible container with smaller, nested blocks inside it. This allows you to completely change the layout of your product listings without any code.

### Example: Moving the Price Above the Image

Let's say you want to create a unique look for your shop by displaying the price before the product image.
 1. Add the Products block to your page.
 2. Select the block, and in the toolbar at the top of the editor, click the **List View** icon.
 3. In the **List View** panel, expand the Products block to see its nested structure. You will find blocks like **Product Image**, **Product Title**, and **Product Price**.
 4. Simply click and drag the **Product Price** block and move it above the **Product Image** block.

Just like that, you have changed the layout for every product in the grid. You can reorder, remove, or customize any of the inner blocks to create the perfect design for your store.

## Customizing Core Layouts with Templates (for Block Themes)

If you are using a modern, block-based WordPress theme, you can edit FluentCart's core templates directly. This gives you control over the fundamental design of your product and archive pages.

### Accessing FluentCart Templates

 1. From your WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance** > **Editor**.
 2. In the Site Editor, select **Templates**.
 3. Look for the FluentCart templates.
  * **Single Product:** This template controls the design of your individual product pages. Edit this to change the layout of the product title, image, description, and price for all products at once.
  * **Products by Category:** This template controls the design of your category pages (the pages that list all products in a category).

## Integrating with Page Builders Bricks

FluentCart's blocks are also fully compatible with popular page builder Bricks. This allows you to seamlessly integrate FluentCart's e-commerce power with the advanced design capabilities of Bricks.
You can use the FluentCart templates directly within the Bricks editor just as you would in the standard WordPress editor, giving you the best of both worlds. 

For other builders that may not have direct block support, FluentCart also provides shortcodes as a flexible way to add product grids and buttons to any design.

> [!TIP] 
>You can always return later to make changes. The Block Editor is flexible, so feel free to experiment without worrying about messing up your layout.
